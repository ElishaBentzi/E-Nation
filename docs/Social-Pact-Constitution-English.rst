The connection as a Foundational Principle.
-------------------------------------------

With the purpose of participating in the creation of a society of
harmony and peace:

I \________________\_ wish to be part of this society, and I commit
myself to have the fundamental basic intention of “not harming any other
human being”, that is, before carrying out any activity, I will take
into consideration that this activity does not cause harm to others.

I accept the truth that: “all human beings are naturally different in
capacities and needs, just as all human beings are equally important”.
That is why, in order to achieve peace, I commit myself to: “support all
the members of this society, so that they can benefit society with their
uniqueness”, with the same force with which I want to express my
uniqueness.

I recognize that life is a process of continuous development and
therefore, consciously or unconsciously, I and the other members of this
society can and will make mistakes. That's why I commit myself to
recognize my mistakes, to ask for mercy for my mistakes, and I promise
to repair them. On the other hand, I promise to judge with mercy the
errors of the other members of this society.

All this I do in order to fulfill the ultimate goal established by
nature for the human race: **to be the guardian of life.**

Freedom implies great responsibility and therefore the citizen must be
educated in using his freedom wisely, since ignorance does not free him
from responsibility and the consequences of his actions.

The education system has the purpose of forming responsible citizens,
knowing society and the world, preparing citizens to be entrepreneurs
and parents of the next generation. It is based on the scientific method
applied with love learning to think scientifically, how to balance human
nature with technological developments.

*Definition:*

**Scientific Method:** 1. Observe. 2. Investigate. 3. Hypothesis. 4.
Experiment. 5. Conclusions or Repeat.

We recognize the existence of mental viruses and that training in the
application of the scientific method is the tool to eliminate them.

*Definition*: **Mental Virus:** Beliefs that limits the development of
the human being. Mental viruses behave just like its biological
counterparts because they mutate and are transmitted between people.
When a paradigm becomes obsolete it becomes a mental virus. There are
also mental viruses that are born as mental viruses.

Stepped learning is recommended, following the development of the
history of mankind.

2.4.1. General Aspects:
'''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Up to 5 years the child should develop gradually in the same way that
   humanity developed until his generation, related first with nature
   and then with technology.
-  The child should grow in increasingly larger circles. Example: from
   the room to the living room, from the living room to the garden etc…
   Here it is important to observe how much the child's desire shows to
   enter the next circle, because the progress must be made according to
   their demand and not by means of pressure (The same happens in the
   transition from the tit to the bottle).
-  From the Kindergarten it would be ideal for each new stage to be
   isolated from the previous and next stages. This allows the educator
   that in each stage can help to develop a homogeneous society where
   there are not strong versus weak.
-  From 3 to 10 years old, the little ones are not in danger of
   absorbing the negative qualities produced by the “cunning” in growth
   of the elderly.
-  From 9 to 12 years old, the genders are separated, including their
   educators, and they are taught roles in primitive social life.
-  From the age of 12, they are taught the roles in postmodern society,
   and to participate in power games, which perform the genres.
   
   2.4.2. Specific Aspects:
''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  From 0 to 18 months: During this period it is recommended to feed
   them breast milk directly from the breast of their mother. At this
   stage your environment is recommended to be surrounded by the least
   amount of stimuli, only your parents, your room and your crib. They
   do not understand wide environments and complex forms (cars, planes,
   TV, Smart Phones, computers).
-  From 18 months to 3 years: Stop perceiving him as a baby, and start
   seeing him as a small child. In this stage he has the capacity to
   learn through games and examples, his parents must show him all kinds
   of ways that they can understand so that internally they begin to
   discern between the good and the bad.
-  From 3 to 5 years old: their development ceases to depend exclusively
   on the home, and kindergarten becomes their main environment for
   growth. During this period emotional development is vital, in
   kindergarten you must learn to relate to adults, with boys and girls,
   learn different types of rules, how to take care of things that can
   hurt your body.
-  At 3 years: they can learn the letters and numbers.
-  At 4 years old: they can learn to read and sing different subjects
   they have memorized. Ex .: colors, numbers, letters …
-  At 5 years: comparisons of quality and quantity. Example: height and
   width, distances, light and dark, etc.
-  From 6 years old: it goes from kindergarten to school. Having
   acquired a correct emotional development, it moves to a new stage
   where mental development is main (scientific knowledge) using the
   KWHLAQ method.
-  From the age of 9, the use and programming of the computer.

Our collective decision-making mechanism is direct democracy with
meritocracy, expressed in the consensus vote and the benevolent
dictator.

*Definitions:*

**Direct Democracy:** The power is not delegated and is always in the
hands of citizens, who participate actively and continuously in
decision-making.

**Meritocracy:** The ability to do a job, either by demonstration when
doing work, or by having a public title that accredits you as capable of
performing the job.

**Consensus Voting:** Decisions that cannot be resolved by technical
analysis are resolved by a limited time vote, on a series of proposals,
with 4 types of votes: 1- Agree, 2- Against, 3- I do not care, 4- First
Dead. The consensus occurs when a proposal reaches ⅔ of type 1 votes and
up to 12% of type 4 votes.

**Benevolent Dictator:** The benevolent dictator is a role that is
earned by merit, since it is a person with the ability to reconcile
contradictory points and his function is to make decisions in the
extreme case that consensus could not be reached. He or She can be
revoked at any time.
