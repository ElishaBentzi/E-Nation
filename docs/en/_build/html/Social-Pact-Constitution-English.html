<h2>The connection as a Foundational Principle.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-connection-as-a-foundational-principle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the purpose of participating in the creation of a society of harmony and peace:</p>
<p>I _________________ wish to be part of this society, and I commit myself to have the fundamental basic intention of “not harming any other human being”, that is, before carrying out any activity, I will take into consideration that this activity does not cause harm to others.</p>
<p>I accept the truth that: “all human beings are naturally different in capacities and needs, just as all human beings are equally important”. That is why, in order to achieve peace, I commit myself to: “support all the members of this society, so that they can benefit society with their uniqueness”, with the same force with which I want to express my uniqueness.</p>
<p>I recognize that life is a process of continuous development and therefore, consciously or unconsciously, I and the other members of this society can and will make mistakes. That’s why I commit myself to recognize my mistakes, to ask for mercy for my mistakes, and I promise to repair them. On the other hand, I promise to judge with mercy the errors of the other members of this society.</p>
<p>All this I do in order to fulfill the ultimate goal established by nature for the human race: <strong>to be the guardian of life.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mental Virus:</strong> Beliefs that limits the development of the human being. Mental viruses behave just like its biological
counterparts because they mutate and are transmitted between people. When a paradigm becomes obsolete it becomes a mental virus. There are also mental viruses that are born as mental viruses.</p>

<h5>2.4.1. General Aspects:<a class="headerlink" href="#general-aspects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Up to 5 years the child should develop gradually in the same way that humanity developed until his generation, related first with nature and then with technology.</li>
<li>The child should grow in increasingly larger circles. Example: from the room to the living room, from the living room to the garden etc. Here it is important to observe how much the child’s desire shows to enter the next circle, because the progress must be made according to their demand and not by means of pressure (The same happens in the transition from the tit to the bottle).</li>
<li>From the Kindergarten it would be ideal for each new stage to be isolated from the previous and next stages. This allows the educator that in each stage can help to develop a homogeneous society where there are not strong versus weak.</li>
<li>From 3 to 10 years old, the little ones are not in danger of absorbing the negative qualities produced by the “cunning” in growth of the elderly.</li>
<li>From 9 to 12 years old, the genders are separated, including their educators, and they are taught roles in primitive social life.</li>
<li>From the age of 12, they are taught the roles in postmodern society, and to participate in power games, which perform the genres.</li>

<h5>2.4.2. Specific Aspects:<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-aspects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<ul class="simple">
<li>From 0 to 18 months: During this period it is recommended to feed them breast milk directly from the breast of their mother. At this stage your environment is recommended to be surrounded by the least amount of stimuli, only your parents, your room and your crib. They do not understand wide environments and complex forms (cars, planes, TV, Smart Phones, computers).</li>
<li>From 18 months to 3 years: Stop perceiving him as a baby, and start seeing him as a small child. In this stage he has the capacity to learn through games and examples, his parents must show him all kinds of ways that they can understand so that internally they begin to discern between the good and the bad.</li>
<li>From 3 to 5 years old: their development ceases to depend exclusively on the home, and kindergarten becomes their main environment for growth. During this period emotional development is vital, in kindergarten you must learn to relate to adults, with boys and girls, learn different types of rules, how to take care of things that can hurt your body.</li>
<li>At 3 years: they can learn the letters and numbers.</li>
<li>At 4 years old: they can learn to read and sing different subjects they have memorized. Ex .: colors, numbers, letters …</li>
<li>At 5 years: comparisons of quality and quantity. Example: height and width, distances, light and dark, etc.</li>
<li>From 6 years old: it goes from kindergarten to school. Having acquired a correct emotional development, it moves to a new stage where mental development is main (scientific knowledge) using the KWHLAQ method.</li>
<li>From the age of 9, the use and programming of the computer.</li>

<p>Our collective decision-making mechanism is direct democracy with meritocracy, expressed in the consensus vote and the benevolent dictator.</p>
<p><em>Definitions:</em></p>
<p><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong> The power is not delegated and is always in the hands of citizens, who participate actively and continuously in decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Meritocracy:</strong> The ability to do a job, either by demonstration when doing work, or by having a public title that accredits you as capable of performing the job.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Voting:</strong> Decisions that cannot be resolved by technical analysis are resolved by a limited time vote, on a series of proposals, with 4 types of votes: 1- Agree, 2- Against, 3- I do not care, 4- First Dead. The consensus occurs when a proposal reaches ⅔ of type 1 votes and up to 12% of type 4 votes.</p>
<p><strong>Benevolent Dictator:</strong> The benevolent dictator is a role that is earned by merit, since it is a person with the ability to reconcile contradictory points and his function is to make decisions in the extreme case that consensus could not be reached. He or She can be revoked at any time.</p>
