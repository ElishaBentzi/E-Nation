E-Nation’s Constitution in **English**
======================================

First Part:
===========

The Foundation.
---------------

With the purpose of participating in the creation of a society of harmony and peace.

I, essence of life incarnated in a living homo, who for interaction with third parties respond to the sound \________________\_, express my desire to be part of this society, and I commit to comply with natural law, with the fundamental intention of "not harm any other human being", that is, before carrying out any activity, I will take into consideration that this activity does not cause harm to others.

I accept the truth that: "all human beings are naturally different in abilities and needs, and that all human beings are equally important." Therefore, to achieve peace, I commit to: "support all members of this society, so that they can benefit society with their uniqueness", with the same strength with which I want to express my uniqueness.

To ensure that this society is one of mutually supportive do-gooders, I put the well-being of others before my own.

I recognize that life is a process of continuous development and therefore, consciously or unconsciously, both I and the other members of this society can make mistakes. That is why I am committed to recognizing, repairing and compensating for my mistakes. On the other hand, I undertake to judge with benevolence the errors of other members of this society.

I do all this in order to fulfill the ultimate goal established by nature for the human race: to be happy by building a better world for all, **being the guardian of life**.

Second Part:
============

Development in Articles of the Constitution that will govern the relations in the e-nation social organization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.
~~
Each community will define its own implementation of the Foundation, the following articles are an example and the default value if not defined.

1.
~~
Freedom implies great responsibility, therefore the citizen must educate himself to use his freedom wisely, since ignorance does not free him from responsibility and the consequences of his actions.

2.
~~
The educational system has the purpose of forming empathetic and responsible citizens, knowledgeable about society and the world, preparing citizens to be entrepreneurs and parents of the next generation. It is based on the scientific method applied with love. Learning to think scientifically and with empathy, without being owners of the truth and always looking for the new version of the truth, balancing human nature with technological developments towards greater self-knowledge and human elevation.

*Definition:*

**Scientific Method:** 
1. Observe.
2. Investigate.
3. Hypothesis.
4. Experiment.
5. Conclusions or Repeat.

2.1.
^^^^
We recognize the existence of mental viruses and traumas, and that training in the application of the scientific method with empathy is the tool to discard and replace them.

*Definition:*

**Mental Virus:** Belief that limits the development of the human being. Mental viruses can be transmitted between people's minds or can be absorbed by the mind from audio-visual media that contain them, on purpose, through ignorance or confusion. Many mental viruses are paradigms that became obsolete with the advancement of human development.

2.2.
^^^^
Families are free to choose the educational center that they consider best suits them, including home schooling.

2.3.
^^^^
Educational centers will be publicly evaluated with the indicators of Mutual Welfare as defined by the community. Circular Education is recommended, with its 10 educational principles. 
1. Social Environment Builds the Person.
2. Personal Example.
3. Equality of Importance.
4. Teaching through Games.
5. Weekly field travels.
6. The Elderly Teach the Minors.
7. “The Small Court”.
8. Record of the Activities in Video.
9. Small Groups with Several Educators (of both genders).
10. Continuous support from Parents.

2.4.
^^^^
Stepped learning is recommended, following the development of mankind.

2.4.1. General Aspects:
'''''''''''''''''''''''
- Until the age of 5, children can gradually develop in the same way that humanity developed up to their generation. Relate first to nature and then to technology.
- Children can grow in ever-widening circles. Example: from the room to the living room, from the living room to the garden, etc. Here it is important to observe how much desire the children show to enter the next circle, since progress must occur in accordance with their demands and not through pressure (which The same thing happens in the transition from the breast to the bottle).
- Starting in Kindergarten, it would be ideal for each new stage to be isolated from the previous and upcoming stages. This allows the educator at each stage to help develop a homogeneous society, where there are no strong and weak but complements.
- From 3 to 10 years old, the little ones are not in danger of absorbing the negative qualities resulting from the growing "cunning" of the older ones.
- From 9 to 12 years old, genders are separated, including their educators, and they are taught roles in basic social life.
- From the age of 12, they are taught technical roles in post-modern society, and the nature of the male and female gender with its impact on the construction or destruction of a society in harmony and peace.
   
2.4.2. Specific Aspects:
''''''''''''''''''''''''
- From 0 to 18 months: During this period it is recommended to feed them breast milk directly from their mother's breast. At this stage, it is recommended that your environment be surrounded by the least amount of stimuli, only your parents, your room and your crib. They do not understand large environments and complex shapes (cars, airplanes, TV, Smart Phones, computers).
- From 18 months to 3 years: Stop perceiving him as a baby, and start seeing him as a small child. At this stage you have the ability to learn through games and examples, your parents can show you all kinds of ways that children can understand so that internally they begin to discern between good and bad.
- From 3 to 5 years: their development stops depending exclusively on the home, and the kindergarten becomes their main growth environment. During this period emotional development is vital, in kindergarten you must learn to relate to adults, with boys and girls, learn different types of rules, how to take care of things that may hurt your body.
- At 3 years old: they can learn letters and numbers.
- At 4 years old: they can learn to read and sing different songs that they have memorized. Example: colors, numbers, letters...
- At 5 years old: comparisons of quality and quantity. Example: height and width, distances, light and dark, etc.
- From 6 years old: go from kindergarten to school. Having acquired correct emotional development, you move on to a new stage where mental development is primary (scientific knowledge) using the KWHLAQ method.
- From the age of 9, the use and programming of the computer.

Our collective decision-making mechanism is direct democracy with meritocracy, expressed in the consensus vote and the benevolent leader.

*Definitions:*

**Direct Democracy:** The power is not delegated and is always in the hands of citizens, who participate actively and continuously in decision-making.

**Meritocracy:** The ability to do a job, either by demonstration when doing work, or by having a public title that accredits you as capable of performing the job.

**Consensus Voting:** Decisions that cannot be resolved by technical analysis are resolved by a limited time vote, on a series of proposals, with 4 types of votes: 1- Agree, 2- Against, 3- I do not care, 4- First Dead. The consensus occurs when a proposal reaches ⅔ of type 1 votes and up to 12% of type 4 votes.

**Benevolent Leader:** The benevolent leader is a role that is earned by merit, since it is a person with the ability to reconcile contradictory points and his function is to make decisions in the extreme case that consensus could not be reached. He or She can be revoked at any time.

3.1.
^^^^
Voting is not anonymous, except in cases where it is necessary, as to avoid damage to a reputation. The votes of the last round can be anonymous.

3.2.

Proposals are added by the benevolent leader or any citizen who receives a minimum of 10% pre-votes (temporary delegations of power).

We operate and organize ourselves in a distributed manner, both in the geographical area and in the distribution of power, avoiding, as far as possible, the formation of centralisms.

4.1.
^^^^
In the geographical area we are a nation, distributed throughout the planet Earth. At the will of citizens, their geo-located assets are part of our geography. At the same time we recognize the geographical spaces of the other nationality of our citizens.

4.2.
^^^^
In the area of power, we seek that the power always resides in the citizen, avoiding delegations of power, except for temporary delegations and revocable at any time that the practice requires for the effective realization of activities.

5.
~~
To get out of the paradigm of measuring everything exclusively with money, two forms of payment are recognized: 1- honor, 2- money.

5.1.
^^^^
Events are promoted to pay with honor, giving public recognitions. These recognitions can be standardized in a hierarchical system of levels, which are achieved by achieving a defined number of points. Example of levels: iron, copper, silver, gold, platinum; each with sub-levels from 1 to 5.

6.
~~
Our economic system is Circular Market Capitalism. With total transparency of the activities of public organizations, in maximum detail in real time.

6.1.
^^^^
The market develops when the two fundamental laws of the economy are fulfilled.

1. **Law of Profit** or loss: incentivize or restrict any type of activity by giving the opportunity of gain or loss, whether real or potential.
2. **Law of Competition**: the necessary requirements for a new company to enter into a market are the minimum possible.

6.1.1.
''''''
All types of virtual or physical currencies are recognized as valid for the cancellation of payments, provided that the parties agree.

6.1.2.
''''''
In order to promote competition in natural monopolies, such as roads, water, electricity, radio spectrum, competition for temporary differentiated use and administrative competence in services is proposed, using a common medium shared by all operators and always leaving the opportunity to try new operators.

6.2.
^^^^
The monetary function, of creating money in our UnityCoin currency, is in organized citizens. This subjugates the State to always be below the Citizen, since it is the Citizen who controls the creation and use of money and not the State.

6.3.
^^^^
The financial function, administration of the State's money (what the money is spent on), in our currency UnityCoin is in the organized citizens.

6.3.1.
''''''
The depreciation of the monetary mass of UnityCoin, as a mechanism of social redistribution, can be implemented in the future to ensure a sustainable economy.

6.4.
^^^^
The State may be the capitalist partner, in those projects that citizens need and the project executors don't have the money to invest.

6.4.1.
''''''
The health and education systems can be financed by the State, while they are administered by private companies or organized citizens. The State and the private participates in the profits and / or losses.

6.5.
^^^^
As the system of production of goods and services requires a continuous injection of money, instead of injecting that money into the banks or the stock exchange system, that injection of money will be made directly to citizens, through a universal minimum income.

6.5.1.
''''''
The state will be responsible for providing a universal minimum income to each citizen. Except for those citizens who receive a salary from the private sector or a guaranteed basic salary (Article 7) as is the case of those who work for the State.

*Definition:*

**Universal Minimum Income:** the amount of monthly money a person needs to survive. With this amount of money, the person can pay their expenses for: food, basic services (water, electricity, telephone, internet), health and hygiene.

6.5.1.1.
""""""""     
To receive this money, every citizen should periodically see or attend a talk where they are educated and remembered that this money comes from the welfare of the society in which they live. If social welfare improves, the amount of money increases, if social welfare decreases, the amount of money received decreases.

6.5.1.2.
""""""""        
The Universal Minimum Income will be implemented progressively and is one of the economic - human goals of the community, starting with children up to the age of 16, women or man dedicated to home or homeschooling, and adults over 60.

6.5.1.2.1.
**********          
This encourages the work of young people, the retirement of our seniors from work, the generational grouping, as well as recognizes the work of women in the home, making it easier for them to continue studying.

6.5.1.3.
""""""""        
For minors up to the age of 16 and for a maximum of two children, the mother or her legal representative receives 50% of the amount of money an adult receives.

6.5.1.3.1.
**********          
In order to favor the natural development of children, the amount increase 10%, if the children are under the continuous authority of a man and a woman (because biologically the Same-sex couples do not reproduce and that the children need the masculine and feminine model).

6.5.1.4.
""""""""
In order to favor the transgenerational grouping, descendants who live with parents over 60 will receive an additional 5% for each parent living with them.

6.5.1.5.
""""""""        
To avoid misuse of universal minimum income, this can be granted with means of payment that support differentiated consumption.

*Definition:*

**Differentiated Consumption:** In physical or virtual stores at the time of payment, the payment terminals distinguish whether the money from the payment means can be used to buy the products. Example: beverages and tobacco cannot be paid with money reserved for food and services. 

**Differentiated Payment:** The price of the product varies with reference to the citizen who pays. Example: older adults pay 50% less, a birthday person pays 20% less.

6.6.
^^^^
In order to give authentic decision-making power to the Citizen, who can make informed decisions when comparing businesses, products and services, the Mutual Wellbeing Indicators are implemented, which is a matrix of indicators available in detail and that for practical and rapid purposes , are summarized iconographically on the product label.

6.6.1.
''''''
The implementation of Mutual Wellbeing Indicators organized into three types: economic, human and ecological. It promotes healthy competition by making a balanced comparison of quality between products, eliminating the failures of a simple price comparison, or of a subjective quality evaluation made with non-standard criteria.

6.6.2.
''''''
All public or private organizations that offer goods or services to the public will be evaluated publicly every six months using the Mutual Wellbeing Indicators matrix. Organizations, products and services will clearly show the result of that evaluation.

6.6.3.
''''''
Organized citizens will publicly and alternately carry out the evaluation of the Mutual Wellbeing Indicators, with all the details of who and how this evaluation was carried out.

6.8.
^^^^
Automation and the use of Artificial Intelligences are promoted in all sectors: public and private, including health and legal sectors, as mechanisms to improve the quality of products and attention to citizens, to reduce costs and free the human being from repetitive tasks. Our economic-financial model allows these improvements to be immediately distributed to all citizens.

7.

The Guaranteed Basic Salary is established, the State is responsible for ensuring the existence of a job for all citizens who require it.

**Work:** It is everything that a citizen does to earn money or honor, favoring society and nature.

**Guaranteed Basic Salary:** It is the amount of monthly money that a person needs to cover all their needs, but not luxuries. It includes everything covered by the Universal Minimum Income plus housing and transportation.

Citizens, companies and other organizations that generate products or services that benefit society and nature are not employment agencies, therefore they can fire workers at any time, and are free to trade with whoever they wish.

7.2.

^^^^
Products that we do not want to promote in society, such as alcohol, tobacco, and soft or hard drugs, can be discouraged by overpricing (as is done today). 200% - 1000% are possible values ​​and are set for each type, example: Alcohol 200%, Cigars 300%, Marijuana 400%.

8.3.1.
''''''
The money collected from overpricing in stores is used for preventive education programs about the negative effects of consuming these products.

8.3.2.
''''''
If the store refuses to apply the overpricing to the products to be discouraged, it will have to notify it publicly and prominently to society.

9.
~~~
The Citizen is responsible and the police for himself, an educational problem requires an educational solution, the State does not have the authority to tell the Citizen what he consumes or not in his private life, the State only informs of the possible damages that are done to himself or the community.

~~
Due to the impossibility of implementing this social pact at one time it will be progressively implemented accepting the limitations imposed by the progressive development of our model.

2.
~~
Recognizing that citizens are not prepared for new systems, as a first approach in a transition, a copy of the archaic State systems can be implemented, periodically evaluating (monthly, bimonthly, quarterly) what parts of this system work? What parts can be updated now? What parts can be changed in the next iteration?

Note:
-----
Due to the existence of the Guaranteed Basic Salary and the Universal Minimum Income, the concepts of social security and social charges no longer apply, such as: retirement, forced unemployment, unjustified dismissal, etc.
