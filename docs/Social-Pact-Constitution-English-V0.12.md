# First Part: 
# The connection as a Foundational Principle.

With the purpose of participating in the creation of a society of harmony and peace:

I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ wish to be part of this society, and I commit myself to have the fundamental basic intention of &quot;not harming any other human being&quot;, that is, before carrying out any activity, I will take into consideration that this activity does not cause harm to others.

I accept the truth that: &quot;all human beings are naturally different in capacities and needs, just as all human beings are equally important&quot;. That is why, in order to achieve peace, I commit myself to: &quot;support all the members of this society, so that they can benefit society with their uniqueness&quot;, with the same force with which I want to express my uniqueness.

I recognize that life is a process of continuous development and therefore, consciously or unconsciously, I and the other members of this society can and will make mistakes. That&#39;s why I commit myself to recognize my mistakes, to ask for mercy for my mistakes, and I promise to repair them. On the other hand, I promise to judge with mercy the errors of the other members of this society.

All this I do in order to fulfill the ultimate goal established by nature for the human race: **to be the guardian of life.**
